/*
BLoC (Business Logic Component), is essentially the front-end
version of a 'Controller'. Views that need to interact with any
weather related data/logic will call out to this object.

The goal of a Bloc is similar to the goal of a UI Component. This
class can be reused by many different components/apps/etc.
